### Background
The project is centered around an A/B test conducted for an online business to evaluate the effectiveness of a new homepage design, particularly a new promotional banner. This analysis aims to understand the influence of this redesign on user interaction and spending, thus aiding in strategic business decisions.

### Key Objectives
- To perform an A/B test comparing the existing and new homepage designs.
- To analyze user response and average expenditure per user.
- To determine the statistical significance of the homepage redesign.
- To visualize data insights using Tableau for easy comprehension and decision-making.
- To present findings through AI-enhanced slides and annotated videos for stakeholder review.

## Data Analysis
### Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For database querying and initial data exploration.
- **Spreadsheet Software**: For conducting detailed statistical and probability analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive and informative visualizations.
- **Presentation Software**: Enhanced with AI tools for clear and engaging presentation of results.

### A/B Testing
- **Duration**: 2 weeks.
